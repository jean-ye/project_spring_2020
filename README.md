For my final project, I would like to write a python script to compute the mean framewise displacement for the fMRI data our lab has.The script will first compute the framewise displacement for each run and then take the average of displacement in all runs from a particular visit. Ideally, the script would be flexible enough to accommodate different tasks and provide some useful information about motion for later analysis.
